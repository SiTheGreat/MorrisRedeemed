// m i'll be right back; ...; m listen, i...; j you hurt me, and I need you to understand and accept that;  you are right. joja was my excuse, but ultimately it was all me/my actions.; j i'm sorry for acting out while wotking for joja, it wasn't your fault i was sent there. you were just a victim of a corporate shill too.; j I'm sorry i tried to use your past aginst you. i had no right.; j i forgive you. but that doesn't mean we're all buddy buddy now! im just tolerating you so i don't have to awkwardly avoid the farmer!; m sweat laugh; fade to black; box 'perhaps this is a good place for redemption for both of us'
